# hello-world
A bunch of _Hello world_ scripts written in various languages.

### Why?
'Hello world' is normally the first thing you learn in a programming language, so I decided to learn just enough of every programming language to create a Hello world program.<br>
How many hello world programs are there? [This link should show every one](https://github.com/iam-py-test/hello-world/search?q=hello+world)
